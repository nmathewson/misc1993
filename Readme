Here are some old programs I found that I'd like to keep around
as a record of how much I've learned in 20 years.

misspell -- prank program to introduce random misspellings into a text
   file.
sublim -- screensaver to flash "subliminal" joke messages
passgen -- phenomenally insecure password generator. Avoid!
wordlist -- no idea why I wrote this. Was it homework?
